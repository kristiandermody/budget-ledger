# Operating Guide for Version 13  
  
This guide outlines how to use the Budget & Ledger workbook under the stable V13 architecture. It assumes that the architecture and money flow models defined in the architecture document are understood.  
  
## Getting Started  
- Copy the `Budget_Ledger_V13.xlsx` file from the releases folder and open it in your spreadsheet application.  
- Each month you will work in the **Budget Template** tab for planning and the **Monthly Ledger** tab for recording transactions.  
  
## Recording Income  
- Enter all incoming funds in the **Deposits** tab. Each deposit initially lands in the **Unassigned** bucket.  
- Use the **Transfers** tab to allocate deposit amounts into budget categories or to Savings & Flex.  
  
## Recording Expenses  
- Record spending in your transaction source (e.g. Trello). Use the JSON→CSV converter to produce a CSV.  
- Paste the CSV into the **Monthly Ledger** tab. Ensure that dates and amounts remain unchanged.  
- Categorize each transaction using the label system. Parent/child categories should match your budget template.  
  
## Handling Refunds  
- If a refund occurs, record it as a positive value in the ledger and label it with the category originally used. Refunds reduce expenses but do not increase income totals.  
  
## Transfers and Reallocations  
- All movement of money between categories, deposits, and Savings & Flex must be done through the **Transfers** tab.  
- Transfers should ensure that **Unassigned** is zero when the month is closed.  
  
## Closing the Month  
- At the end of the month, verify that all deposits have been allocated and that **Unassigned** equals zero.  
- Any remaining surplus should be transferred to Savings & Flex or other designated categories.  
- The month should not be reopened except to correct errors; use transfers in the current month to handle adjustments.  
  
## Reconciliation  
- Compare your checking account balance against the total of Savings & Flex and current category balances.  
- Resolve any discrepancies before closing the month.  
  
## Future Considerations  
- This guide may evolve with future versions (v14+). Ensure that you consult the appropriate guide for the version you are using.
