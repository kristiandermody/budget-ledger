# Version 13.1 Operating Addendum

This addendum explains how to use the ledger with the structural refinements introduced in version 13.1.

## Entering Transactions

- **Amounts must be absolute**: Always enter positive numbers; the transaction type determines the sign internally.
- **Transaction type controls sign**: Use Deposit for money coming in and Expense for money going out.
- **Classification rules**: Assign each transaction an economic classification (Income, Refund, Pass-Through, or Standard) and specify its category and subcategory.
- **Split inheritance behavior**: When splitting a transaction into multiple lines, the direction and classification are inherited from the parent transaction.
- **Migration from v13**: For existing v13 workbooks, re-enter transactions following the new structure; no automated conversion is provided.
