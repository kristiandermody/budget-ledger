# Roadmap for Version 14  

This roadmap outlines planned enhancements for the next major version (v14). These items are aspirational and subject to refinement.  

## Goals  
- Implement a hidden Master Data sheet to centralize categories, accounts, and dropdown sources.  
- Build a Python-based JSON-to-CSV converter with validation engine for automated ledger imports.  
- Automate reconciliation logic between checking and Savings & Flex.  
- Develop dashboards or summary views for budget performance.  
- Address known edge cases from v13 (checking vs savings mismatch, surplus handling, multi-parent splits).  
- Explore integration with external tools (e.g., Trello API) for direct data import.  

Please note that v14 will constitute a major architectural change; any changes will be documented in a new architecture file.
