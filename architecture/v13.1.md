# Version 13.1 Architecture Addendum

This addendum documents the minor structural refinement for version 13.1 of the Budget & Ledger system. The V13 philosophy remains unchanged.

## Ledger Dimensional Formalization

- **Direction axis**: Transaction Type defines direction (Deposit or Expense)
- **Economic classification axis**: Classifies each entry as Income, Refund, Pass-Through, or Standard
- **Purpose axis**: Specifies Category and Subcategory for each transaction
- **Hidden Signed Amount authority**: Sign of amounts is managed internally and not visible to users
- **Removal of Authorized Date**: The Authorized Date field has been eliminated
- **Validation rules**: Updated rules enforce proper dimensional entries and constraints

V13 architecture philosophy is unchanged by these structural clarifications.
