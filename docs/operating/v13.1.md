# Version 13.1 Operating Addendum


This addendum explains how to use the ledger with the structural refinements introduced in version 13.1. The V13 architecture and operating philosophy remain unchanged.

## Entering Transactions

Version 13.1 formalizes the dimensional structure of ledger entries. When recording transactions:

- **Amounts must be absolute**: Always enter positive numbers. The **Transaction Type** determines the sign internally.
- Use **Deposit** for money coming in and **Expense** for money going out.
- Assign each transaction an **Economic Classification** (Income, Refund, Pass-Through, or Standard).
- Specify the appropriate **Category** and **Subcategory** for each transaction.

## Split Transactions

- When splitting a transaction into multiple lines, both the **Transaction Type** and **Economic Classification** are inherited from the parent transaction.
- Split rows differ only by **Category/Subcategory** and **Amount**.
- The sum of all split amounts must equal the parent transaction amount.

## Migration from V13

- For existing V13 workbooks, transactions must be re-entered following the new dimensional structure.
- No automated conversion is provided.
- Ensure that all transactions include a Transaction Type and Economic Classification before closing the month.

## Operational Invariants

The following remain unchanged from V13:

- **Unassigned must equal zero at month close.**
- All allocation and budget capacity changes must occur via the **Transfers** tab.
- Reconciliation must follow the defined system formula.

Version 13.1 introduces structural clarity but does not change allocation logic, reconciliation logic, or budget behavior.
