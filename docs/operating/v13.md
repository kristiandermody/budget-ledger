# Operating Guide for Version 13


This guide outlines how to use the Budget & Ledger workbook under the V13 architecture baseline. It assumes that the architecture and money flow models defined in the architecture document are understood.

## Getting Started
- Copy the `Budget_Ledger_V13.xlsx` file from the releases folder and open it in your spreadsheet application.
- Each month you will work in the **Budget Template** tab for planning and the **Monthly Ledger** tab for recording transactions.

## Recording Income
- Enter all incoming funds in the **Deposits** tab.
- Each deposit initially appears as **Unassigned** (unallocated cash).
- Use the **Transfers** tab to convert deposits (via Unassigned) into **budget capacity** and/or into **allocation buckets** (Flex / Savings / Long-Term Savings).

## Recording Expenses
- Record spending in your transaction source (e.g. Trello). Use the JSON → CSV converter to produce a CSV.
- Paste the CSV into the **Monthly Ledger** tab.
- Ensure that posted dates and amounts remain unchanged.
- Categorize each transaction using the label system. Parent/child categories should match your budget template.

## Handling Refunds
- If a refund occurs, record it as a positive value in the ledger.
- Label it with the category originally used.
- Refunds reduce expenses but do not increase income totals.

## Transfers and Reallocations
- All movement of money between deposits, budget capacity, and allocation buckets must be done through the **Transfers** tab.
- Transfers must ensure that **Unassigned** is zero when the month is closed.

## Closing the Month
- At the end of the month, verify that all deposits have been allocated and that **Unassigned equals zero**.
- Any remaining surplus should be transferred to allocation buckets as appropriate.
- The month should not be reopened except to correct errors; use transfers in the current month to handle adjustments.

## Reconciliation
- At month close, **Unassigned must equal zero**.
- Your checking account balance must equal:

  **Total Allocation Balances − Flex loans taken**

- Flex may temporarily carry a negative balance (representing a loan), which adjusts the reconciliation target.
- Resolve any discrepancies before closing the month.

## Future Considerations
- This guide may evolve with future versions (v14+).
- Always consult the operating guide corresponding to the version of the workbook you are using.
